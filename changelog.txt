- Added txids array with "listreceivedbyaddress" and "listreceivedbyaccount" RPC calls, at least one exchange requested it


***** Version 5.1.0.1a (INTERMEDIATE)
- BUGFIX: Fixed ancient compiler bug std::to_string (used boost::to_string instead, file rpcwallet.cpp)


***** Version 5.1.0.1 (RELEASE)
- Added RPC method "dustwallet", to be able to dust wallet from daemon as well given a series of parameters
- Added RPC method "listcoins", to display the selection made by the RPC call above (useful to report eventual issues)
- BUGFIX: subfolders under /images in theme were not managed, created 'list.v2.txt' and 'createDir::' tag to handle any subfolder, any level
- Added a message "There's a new theme pack" when opening the "Themes" tab
- BUGFIX: when a theme is not selected, makes no sense to attempt loading a folder... Fixed this error visible only in console.


***** Version 5.0.0.1 (RELEASE)
- Project is now fully ported to QT5
- Remove self rescan at boot under certain conditions, not necessary anymore
- BUGFIX: network did not sync with only two nodes, cPeerBlockCountsList declaration fix (don't add an initial zero value)
- BUGFIX: when network resume after sleep or offline, clear the cPeerBlockCountsList internal vectors (BUG introduced by the above BUGFIX)
- BUGFIX: icon in QT when syncing, reflect the status of the IsInitialBlockDownload() function, and not another different logic
- Start over command: dump the chain files and start syncing from fresh with 1 click
- Now possible to disable system notification by a setting in Options dialog (cannot suppress critical notifications, only informational and warning)
- BUGFIX: listreceivedbyaddress RPC call, now accepts 3 parameters correctly (at least one exchange uses the call)
- BUGFIX: on QT5, autocompleter was not automatically hidden when pressing enter to execute the RPC command
- Added listalerts, sendrule, listrules RPC calls, to handle rule sending from any node (with the alert private key)
- BUGFIX: revisited toolbars, button names, positioning and made space for one more page: Log
- Adding Events tab, to display active alerts, information, warnings and critical messages in clear
- BUGFIX: if the wallet is not encrypted, make no sense to have the "Unlock to stake" menu command enabled...
- Display a message when dameon is attempting to connect to RPC but the wallet is still loading the blockchain
- BUGFIX: changed all references to "bicoin-xxx" thread names into "litecoinplus-xxx" names
- Pre-programmed a series of rules in the code for first release of PALADIN (see white paper for version 5.0.0.1)
- "getinfo" RPC method, removed errors/alerts, exposed Rule Height/Rule Sync status as a number/boolean instead
- QT creates the LitecoinPlus.conf file if it doesn't exist
- Automatic ID management for alerts, either for direct alerts or alert/rule packets
- BUGFIX: do not show "info" and "warning" alerts as critical in the system dbus notification, just those who are
- Added a suffix letter in version format for testnet, necessary when testing ('LitecoinPlus-[x]:X.X.X.X')
- Ported back -netoffline option that was in unpublished 4.1.0.1 (possibility to start the wallet offline)
- BUGFIX: adjusted behavior of rule_sync: rules.dat no, height 0 rule_sync=false; rules.dat yes, height 1 wallet offline rule_sync=false
- BUGFIX: PoS minting icon, different logic than the thread itself, let's all use the same logic, shall we...
- BUGFIX: IsInitialBlockDownload behaves incorrectly when syncing from zero, exiting its status almost immediately
- listalerts: added an optional [show_rules=false] parameters, to hide rule packets by default, unnecessary to see for non devs, but useful for eventual troubleshoot
- MAJOR FIX: QT version wasted an immense amount of resources when sending coins from many inputs, removed an unnecessary signal when marking spent coins
- Changed threshold of 10000 bytes to 30000 bytes in advanced coin controls (about 200 inputs can be safely manually selected)
- Changed block amount from 50 to 80 for automatic dusting, considering the new found speed for the major fix above
- Make universally compile version: QT4 and QT5 at the same time (on Windows, still need to use QT4 for compile reasons...)
