- Added RPC method "listcoins", to display the selection made by the RPC call above (useful to report eventual issues)

- Added a message "There's a new theme pack" when opening the "Themes" tab

- BUGFIX: icon in QT when syncing, reflect the status of the IsInitialBlockDownload() function, and not another different logic
- Start over command: dump the chain files and start syncing from fresh with 1 click
- Now possible to disable system notification by a setting in Options dialog (cannot suppress critical notifications, only informational and warning)

- Ported back -netoffline option that was in unpublished 4.1.0.1 (possibility to start the wallet offline)
- BUGFIX: adjusted behavior of rule_sync: rules.dat no, height 0 rule_sync=false; rules.dat yes, height 1 wallet offline rule_sync=false
- BUGFIX: PoS minting icon, different logic than the thread itself, let's all use the same logic, shall we...
- BUGFIX: IsInitialBlockDownload behaves incorrectly when syncing from zero, exiting its status almost immediately
- listalerts: added an optional [show_rules=false] parameters, to hide rule packets by default, unnecessary to see for non devs, but useful for eventual troubleshoot
- MAJOR FIX: QT version wasted an immense amount of resources when sending coins from many inputs, removed an unnecessary signal when marking spent coins
- Changed threshold of 10000 bytes to 30000 bytes in advanced coin controls (about 200 inputs can be safely manually selected)
- Changed block amount from 50 to 80 for automatic dusting, considering the new found speed for the major fix above
